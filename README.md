# Overview

I created this software to increase my understanding of how to integrate SQL commands into Python code and how to connect to a SQL server.

**{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}**

My purpose for building this software is to create and maintain a relational database that imitates database of employees and departments and stores each individual's information.

**{It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how you created the Relational Database.}**

Here is a demo of my software: [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here)

# Relational Database

I created this relational database using MySQL.

**{Describe the structure (tables) of the relational database that you created.}**

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.8.5 32-bit
* Git / GitHub
* mysql.connector module - allows a user to connect to their local MySQL server.

# Useful Websites

* [MySQL Python Connector Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/)
* [Basic SQL Commands](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
* [Using Python with MySQL](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mysql_getstarted.asp)

# Future Work

* Add the capability to remove and modify departments as well.
* Have each department contain all of the employees rather than repeating the department for every employee in the inner join.
* Put in more fields in the employees and departments tables, like gender, availability, department abbreviations, etc.
